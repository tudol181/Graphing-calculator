The application receives a function(string) like: f(x)=sin(x) and after that it displays the graphic of that function. In the display page there are 3 buttons for MIN, MAX, and asymptote that after being pressed reveal the minimum, maximum points or asymptotes.
You can go back at any time to the function page and write a new function to be displayed.
